#  Union Ships During the Civil War

## Introduction

This repo contains some work I have been doing on gathering a list of ships used by the Union during the US Civil War. This work was motivated by a discussion I heard on the Union Navy by [Drachinifel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tqD11AO1Iw). I was surprised to learn that the US Navy during the Civil War was so large. Drach commented that it was primarily a river navy with relatively little blue water capability. I decided to put together a list of the Union ships and some characteristics that would allow me to assess its capabilities.

## Background

### Definitions

<dl>
<dt>Blockade Operations</dt>
<dd>I created this category out the various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_the_line">ships of the line</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloop-of-war">sloops</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schooner">schooners</a> that were used to enforce the blockade. These were generally large sailing vessels that were suitable for ocean operation.</dd>
<dt>Gunboat</dt>
<dd>A gunboat is a naval watercraft designed for the express purpose of carrying one or more guns to bombard coastal targets (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunboat">Wikipedia</a>). In the Civil War, these ships were often commercial vessels purchased by the Union and that mounted a small number of cannons.</dd>
<dt>Obstacle</dt>
<dd>A number of boats were acquired to sink as obstacles in channels. For more information on these ships, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Fleet">stone fleet</a>.</dd>
<dt>Torpedo Boat</dt>
<dd>These were small boats that were fitted with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spar_torpedo">spar torpedoes</a>.</dd>
